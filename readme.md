CAUTION:
--------
This is patConfiguration 2.0.0
patConfiguration is now driver-based and not restricted to XML files anymore.
Furthermore it uses patErrorManager to handle errors.
That means it breaks BC in most cases!

You downloaded this as a CVS snapshot. This version still contains
some bugs and should not be used in a production environment.
